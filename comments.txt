1) Classifying simple actions to judge how well a complex task is done. - N
    > Come up with various classes of actions and rate them.
1) Adding rotation as a action and incorporating it into action plan. - J
    > Rotation is an action under the class 'motion'.
    > It involves rotating at the location the robot currently is.
    > The robot is able to rotate by itself and human beings can force the robot to rotate using arrows at the top.
    > Model arrows as buttons.
1) The robot is supposed to turn. - J
    > See above.
1) Making the robot aware of the level it is at/ what floor it got out. - J
    > Add a 'z' coordinate to all appropriate positions. 
    > Also add the 'z' coordinate to the elevator planar position.
    > Use numbers.
1) The robot must not move/lock when its drawers are open. - N/J
    > Drawer has a state which determines whether it is open or not.
1) Human beings should be able to summon the robot. - N
    > The robot should have a queue of tasks. FIFO. 
    > Robot should receive appropriate signals through its communication module.

2) Merge the elevators into a single eleator for both humans and robots. - J
    > The elevators have a maximum weight based capacity and the root uses obstacle detection 
    to determine whether the elevator is full.
2) Add obstacle detection. - J/N
    > Monitoring. 
    > If an obstacle is found, the robot finds an alternative path.
    > Other alternatives such as not moving and communicating appropriate error message.
    > If it is a movable obstacle check again.

3) Leave the elevator incase of an emergency. - N
    > See action below.
3) Classify an emergency. - N
    > Link it to the security level of the drawers.
    > Emergency is determined with a special panic button. 
    > Model the big red button.

4) Leave the elevator only when it is at the right floor.
    > Communicate with the elevator . If you are feeling fancy use computer vision.
    > This action follows move elevator.
4) Model the actions of the elevator as a queue of floors to access.
    > The robot uses this to determine which elevator to take.

* Extend the communication module. 
* Smarter elevator choices and task decisions.
