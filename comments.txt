* The rooms in the hospital do not have (x,y,z) location coordinates. But this is mentioned in the delivery locaiton for the robot.
This needs to be changed.
    I have created a value: Planar_Position, and have given this to rooms and elevators in hospital
    I suggest we remove the absolute position of the delivery location and just give the id of the room to which the robot should go
DONE The 'elevatorDistance' attribute needs to be deleted.
    see above
* Camera (1, 360*) with perception software needs to be added to the robot.
* Location software grounding (centrally) to create a plan to move.
* Software to count doors. Recognize doors. Ground door.
* Movement plan instead of grid based movement system.
* Change task evaluation method - Scores/actions need to be changed.
