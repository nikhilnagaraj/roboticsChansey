* The rooms in the hospital do not have (x,y,z) location coordinates. But this is mentioned in the delivery locaiton for the robot.
This needs to be changed.
    I have created a value: Planar_Position, and have given this to rooms and elevators in hospital
    I suggest we remove the absolute position of the delivery location and just give the id of the room to which the robot should go
        I AGREE. We should remove the absolute position fo the delivery location.
DONE The 'elevatorDistance' attribute needs to be deleted.
    see above
DONE * Camera (1, 360*) with perception software needs to be added to the robot.
    I have added a camera and a perception module for this.
DONE * Software to count doors. Recognize doors. Ground door.
    Door has been grounded in building meta models
    The perception module can recognize doors.
    The perception module stores the world model it recognizes and the processing module process this 
    to obtain relevant data, in this case the number of doors.

* Location software grounding (centrally) to create a plan to move.   
* Movement plan instead of grid based movement system.
* Change task evaluation method - Scores/actions need to be changed.
